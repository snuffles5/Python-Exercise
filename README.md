# Python-Exercise

## Description: 
This is a Python exercise project that manipulates JSON data and outputs the manipulated data to a new JSON file. The data manipulator class takes a pathlib.Path as its only parameter and reads JSON data from the file into a dictionary using the pathlib, json, and dict modules. It then processes the data by changing the year of datetime values to 2021, removing whitespaces and reversing the string for string values, and removing duplicates for lists. Finally, it saves the processed data to a new file in JSON format using the pathlib module.
